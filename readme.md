The web page (`index.html` and `styles/styles.css`) is designed for maximum compatibility across devices:

* **Desktop View:** The PDF is embedded directly, filling the entire browser window for seamless reading.
* **Mobile Fallback:** On mobile screens, the embedded PDF is hidden. Instead, a clean interface displays a message and a direct **"Open Jinvani PDF"** link, which prompts the user to open the file in their native, full-screen document viewer for a better experience.
